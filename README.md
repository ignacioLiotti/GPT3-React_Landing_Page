#### Main Page
  The landing page per se, the one with the most content, mainly focused in on first view animations, staggered animations and so on, only functional buttons are the 
  get started, sign in, sign up, request early access, leading to a login or register.
  
  It has been optimized even further from the first deployment as the size of the images files where quite enormous. Also added lazy loading for every image after the 
  hero section.

  further improvement could be achieve but its a great start for just a for fun project.
  
  One issue noted, but not solved, is the waves animation in the possibilities section, witch may cause lag in some devises, supposedly Framer motion uses CSS
  transform for their animations, witch uses the GPU instead of the CPU, witch leads to a better performance and smoother animations, so futher research is due to    solve this

  Mockup register, its not integrated with anything, as it is not the intended purpose for this project, mostly added for proper pagination.
#### Login

  404 page, wanted to mess up still a bit with the design in figma and the floating head animation, a nice addition imo
